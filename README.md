# User-Authentication---Authorization---Sessions
This is a simple site I made during watching udemy 100 days web-dev course. This project is for practicing user Authentication and working with sessions.
This site is built with ejs, css, js, node.js and mongodb.
To view the site locally make sure you have node.js and mongodb installed. Then in terminal and in project directory run "npm install" in order to install required packages. Then run "npm start" and after that in your browser search for "localhost:3000".
